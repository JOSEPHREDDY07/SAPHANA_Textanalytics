Itâ€™s also shorter than the normal pampers and the art is similar but not the same. Buyer beware!');

As a result we made the decision to switch to Gerber Extensive HA and 
have had great success with it for several weeks now. After switching to 
Gerber we noticed an almost immediate reduction in reflux and stomach discomfort and 
now have a very happy baby. This formula is working very well for our baby and if you 
are having issues with the other hypoallergenic options this is probably worth a shot.');
